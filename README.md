## Credits

Thanks so much to:

- [ZipLocate](http://ziplocate.us/) for providing an API to convert zip
codes to Latitude and Longitude!
- [crossorigin.me](https://crossorigin.me/) for being my trusty CORS proxy to
keep it all in the front end!
- [Hanna Jung](https://dribbble.com/Jung_Hanna) for the icon
freebies that I used (and modified slightly) in the app!
- [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev/) for the weather API!
